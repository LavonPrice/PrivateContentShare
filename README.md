# Private Content Sharing Platform

A secure, decentralized content sharing platform built with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology powered by Zama, enabling users to share confidential content with complete privacy and access control.

## üîê Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
This platform leverages Zama's FHE technology to enable computation on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. This revolutionary approach ensures that:

- Content remains encrypted both at rest and during computation
- Smart contracts can process encrypted data without accessing plain text
- Privacy is maintained throughout the entire content lifecycle
- Zero-knowledge proofs validate access rights without revealing content

### Confidential Content Platform
The platform creates a secure marketplace for sensitive information where:

- **Content Creators** can monetize confidential data while maintaining full control
- **Content Consumers** can access encrypted information with guaranteed privacy
- **Smart Contracts** handle access permissions and payments automatically
- **Blockchain** provides immutable audit trails for all transactions

## üåü Key Features

### üîí **End-to-End Encryption**
All content is encrypted using FHE before being stored on-chain, ensuring complete privacy from creation to consumption.

### üí∞ **Monetized Access Control**
Creators can set access prices and control who can view their confidential content through time-limited access tokens.

### ‚è∞ **Time-Based Access**
Access tokens expire automatically, providing granular control over content availability and reducing unauthorized sharing.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Revocable Permissions**
Content creators can instantly revoke access permissions, providing real-time control over sensitive information.

### üìä **Transparent Analytics**
Blockchain-based tracking of content access patterns while maintaining user privacy through encrypted interactions.

## üöÄ Platform Capabilities

### For Content Creators
